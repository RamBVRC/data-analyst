TASK 16 – Time Series Forecasting Report

Objective: To analyze historical sales data and forecast future sales
using time series forecasting techniques.

Dataset Used: Sales Forecasting Dataset (Monthly Sales Data)

Steps Performed: 1. Converted Date column into datetime format. 2.
Aggregated sales monthly. 3. Visualized sales trend over time. 4. Split
data into train and test sets (time-based split). 5. Applied Exponential
Smoothing model. 6. Generated forecast for next 6 months. 7. Calculated
error metrics (MAE and MAPE). 8. Exported forecast results to CSV.

Model Used: Exponential Smoothing (Additive Trend)

Results: Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 350.25 Mean Absolute Percentage
Error (MAPE): 3.4%

Insights: - Sales show an upward trend. - Model performs well with low
percentage error. - Forecast supports business planning and inventory
decisions.

Conclusion: Time series forecasting helps businesses predict demand and
optimize planning.
