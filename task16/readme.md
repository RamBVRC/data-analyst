🎯 Objective

To perform time-series analysis on sales data and forecast future demand using statistical forecasting models.

🛠 Tools Used

Primary Tool: Python (Google Colab)

Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, statsmodels, scikit-learn

Alternative Tools (Optional): Excel Forecast Sheet, Power BI (Basic Forecasting)

📂 Dataset

Sales Forecasting Dataset
(Store Item Demand / Walmart Sales / Monthly Sales Data)

🔄 Project Workflow

Loaded dataset and converted Date column into datetime format

Aggregated sales data monthly using groupby

Visualized sales trend over time

Checked trend behavior using rolling average

Split dataset into time-based train and test sets

Applied Exponential Smoothing forecasting model

Predicted next 6 months sales

Evaluated model using:

MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)

Exported forecast results into CSV file

📈 Model Used

Exponential Smoothing (Additive Trend Model)

📊 Results

MAE: 350.25

MAPE: 3.4%

The low MAPE indicates good forecast accuracy.

💡 Key Insights

Sales show an upward trend.

Forecasting helps in demand planning and inventory management.

Time-based splitting prevents data leakage.

Model performs reliably for short-term prediction.
