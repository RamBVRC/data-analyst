## 📌 Objective
Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using Python to understand the dataset, identify patterns, detect outliers, and prepare a cleaned dataset for further analysis or modeling.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

---

## 📂 Deliverables

### 1️⃣ task10_eda.ipynb
- Load and inspect the dataset
- Check shape, info, and head of the data
- Generate descriptive statistics using `.describe()`
- Visualize distributions (histograms & boxplots)
- Detect outliers using the **IQR method**
- Add outlier flag and handle outliers

### 2️⃣ cleaned_dataset.csv
- Dataset after outlier handling
- Cleaned and ready for further analysis or modeling

### 3️⃣ eda_findings.txt
- Summary of EDA results
- Explanation of outlier detection approach
- Key insights and observations

---

## 🔍 Key Analysis Performed
- Missing value analysis
- Distribution analysis
- Outlier detection using Interquartile Range (IQR)
- Basic correlation analysis
- Data cleaning and validation

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Learned
- Importance of EDA before modeling
- How IQR method identifies outliers
- Why not all outliers should always be removed
- Relationship between correlation and causation
- Handling skewed data

---

## 📊 Dataset (Sample / Reference)
- House Prices Dataset
