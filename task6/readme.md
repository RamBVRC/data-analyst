# 📊 Task 6: Data Visualization – Python Charts for Insights

## 🔍 Overview
This task focuses on visualizing real-world datasets using Python to extract meaningful insights.  
The objective is to analyze trends, distributions, and relationships between variables using clear and professional charts.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Platform:** Google Colab  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries Used:**
  - pandas
  - matplotlib

---

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset used for this task is one of the following:
- World Happiness Report  
- COVID-19 Dataset  
- Retail Sales Dataset  

The dataset was cleaned and verified before performing any visualizations.

---

## 📈 Visualizations Performed
The following charts were created as part of the analysis:

- **Bar Chart:** Displays the top 10 categories/products based on total sales or revenue  
- **Line Chart:** Shows time-series trends such as sales over months  
- **Histogram:** Represents the distribution of numerical values like profit or ratings  
- **Scatter Plot:** Illustrates correlation between two variables (e.g., revenue vs profit)

All charts include proper titles, axis labels, legends, gridlines, and suitable figure sizes for better readability.

## 💡 Key Insights
- Identified trends and peak values in time-series data  
- Observed data distribution and detected outliers using histograms  
- Analyzed correlation between variables using scatter plots  

(Three detailed insights are documented inside the notebook.)
